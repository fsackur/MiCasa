# MiCasa

A powershell module for [Chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io/).

## What is Chezmoi?

For every machine you log onto, you probably wish you had your handy scripts installed.... not to mention other little pieces of config (git, SSH, kubernetes).

Chezmoi is a git-backed dotfile manager. It manages files in your home folder. You push changes to git and pull them on other machines.

This module makes chezmoi more comfortable to use in powershell.
